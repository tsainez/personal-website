Hello, I'm Tony Sainez. Right now, I'm working on improving autonomous vehicle performance through **hands-on testing at various proving grounds**. I got my start working for Waymo's testing team in Atwater, and then moved to Zoox.

I never expected to be in the automotive industry, but this is great niche for me. I've been obsessed with **artificial intelligence** since I was a teenager, when I found out that they could beat me at videogames.
