## 2025-05-18 - Skip to Content Links in Jekyll Themes
**Learning:** Default Jekyll themes like `minima` often lack "skip to main content" links, which are a critical accessibility feature.
**Action:** When customizing Jekyll sites, always verify if a skip link exists. If not, override the `default.html` layout (and any other root layouts) to include one, and ensure the target element (usually `<main>`) has the corresponding ID. The CSS 'clip' pattern is a reliable way to hide it visually until focused.

## 2025-05-20 - Programmatic Focus on Non-Interactive Elements
**Learning:** Calling `.focus()` on `document.body` (or other non-interactive containers) silently fails in many contexts unless the element explicitly has `tabindex="-1"`. This leaves screen reader users stranded at the bottom of the page after actions like "Back to Top".
**Action:** When managing focus programmatically to a container (like resetting view to top), dynamically add `tabindex="-1"` before focusing, and optionally remove it on blur to keep the DOM clean.
