My official job title is an oxymoron. 

I'm an "**autonomous vehicle operator**," which says nothing— just like a lot of other job titles.

Actually, it was my first job right out of college. After a drug test and just a few weeks of training, I was put behind the wheel and told to takeover when necessary. I *really* thought I'd be stuck in a dreary cubicle within the depths of some carpeted dungeon.

All of my work happens in closed-off testing facilities, instead of on public roads. We're given these huge concrete wastelands where some software engineers have crafted imaginary cities for these cars to drive around. But, someone still has to actually put it into drive, place the cones, or sometimes just walk out in-front of it.

Originally, I just wanted a job— any job! But, I've begun to love the job for many reasons. I've traveled across the country to different testing grounds while working with so many car nerds that their enthusiasm has begun to rub off on me. I've grown to become a true believer that, if done correctly, this technology will save lives.
